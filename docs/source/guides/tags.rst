Bloody Tags!!
*************

Tags are central to Condution since they're largely what inform perspectives and dictate task weight. In this guide, we'll guide you through the different ways to create and interact with tags as well as delete them.

Creating a Tag
++++++++++++++

There are two main ways to create a tag. The first and recommended way is to simply move to the tags box within a task, type the tags name, and hit enter. If this name doesn't match the name of any other existing tag, it'll simply create a new one and assign it to that task.

The second way is to navigate to the tags pane inside the task and hit "New Tag" as shown below.

Doing so will create a new tag with the name "New Tag". To rename it, simply click on that tag and set the name box as shown below to the desired name.

Deleting Tags
+++++++++++++

Deleting tags is a very very useful feature that was missing in Condution for far too long. Many Condution veterans will recite bloodcurdling tales of mistyping a tag name only to end up with a typo tag. One that was impossible to be rid of and would almost always pop up in the dropdown instead of the desired one.
