Tasks are the center of every productivity app which is why they're so crucial to understand. In this guide, we'll walk you through the different ways to add and interact with tasks.

Adding a task
-------------

There are two ways to make a task. If you're inside a project, you can simply press the add a task button. However, if in the moment simply want to add a task to your inbox for later sorting, you can use our FAB (Floating Action Button) as seen below.

To make your life even easier, our FAB has NLP support. This means you can simply say things like "Wash the car from 8 to 9 on sunday" and it'll add a task with the deffer date of Sunday at 8 and due date of sunday at 9.

Inside a task
-------------

Inside of the task there are quite a few elements as can be seen in the below diagram.

The Globe Button

The globe button toggles between floating and fixed timezones.

Let's say for example you needed to call your mother at 8pm every Friday and one day you happen to travel to Japan. If you had fixed timezones enabled (the default), when you arrive, calling your mother would appear due 8pm plus the time difference between wherever you live and Japan.

However, say for example you want to do Yoga between 5-6pm as well, but you wanted to do it at 5-6pm whereever you are, you can used Floating Timezones.
